# RESTful App

## Introduction

Your task is to build a fully RESTful Express app! You should include full CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update and Delete).

## Exercise

The `starter-code` has the following file structure:

```bash
.
├── config
│   └── environment.js
│   └── routes.js
├── db
│   └── seeds.js
├── index.js
├── models
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── public
├── src
│   ├── js
│   │   └── app.js
│   └── css
│       └── style.css
└── views
    ├── error.ejs
    ├── home.ejs
    └── layout.ejs
```

The Express app boilerplate has already been added for you. There is one static route in `config/routes.js` that renders the homepage (`views/home.ejs`).

### Setup

In the terminal, run the following commands:

```bash
yarn install
nodemon
```

Navigate to `localhost:3000` in Chrome.


#### Requirements

Use your lesson notes along with the classwork from today as a reference.

* You should have two models (of your choice)
* You should be able to perform full CRUD actions on AT LEAST one of your models
* Create a seeds file. (Feel free to use the one from last night's homework)

#### Bonus

Style it up! Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, Skeleton or Foundation if you like.

#### Tips
- Make sure you work SLOWLY through the task, testing regularly as you go
- Write out a list of things to do before you start
- Don't forget to add your 3rd party software (Method Override anyone?!)
