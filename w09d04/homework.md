# Rails API - Multiple Relationships

### Introduction

Your task is to build a Rails API. You can build anything, but it must meet the requirements below.

### Requirements

* Have at least one `has_and_belongs_to_many` relationship
* Have at least one `has_many` and `belongs_to` relationship
* Must be able to view related data in the JSON payload - for example, view a book's author when requesting book data
* Have a seeds file that holds at least one of each model

### Tips

* Plan your database structure using ERD diagrams.
* Test your API often in Insomnia.
* Avoid deleting the app and starting again if you make a mistake. Use migrations to change the structure of your database if you need to add, edit or delete a field.

### Bonus

* Add validations to your models
* Add relevant custom methods to your serializers
