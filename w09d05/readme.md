In this challenge I used JQuery and Bootstrap for my results.
The progress bar is a Bootstrap item, and the JQuery accessed the dom elements.

I had difficulty figuring out how to get the goal remaining value to move with the status bar while it was outside of the bar, and am looking forward to seeing how it is accomplished.
