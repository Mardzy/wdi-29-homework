# React Sorting & Filtering Lab

### Introduction

Your task is to take the `starter-code` provided and build out a React app that lists cheeses from an Express API, and allows the user to sort and filter them on the index page. Your app does **not** need to be fully RESTful - but it should have an index and show page.

The Express API has already been built for you. Run the following commands in the terminal to get started:

```sh
yarn install
yarn seed
yarn start:server
yarn start:client
```

**Important**: `Cheese` and `Country` are two seperate models in the Express API. This means that to get a cheese's country printing on the page you will need to say `cheese.country.name`.

###Â Requirements

* An index page that shows all cheeses
* A show page that displays a single cheese
* On the index page add a dropdown to allow the user to sort by the following:
	* Name: A - Z
	* Name: Z - A
	* Strength: Low to high
	* Strength: High to low
* **Name: A - Z** should be the default option when the page loads
* Add a search bar to allow the user to search by a cheese's name

### Bonus

* If there are no cheeses after filtering/sorting display a message to the user saying **0 cheeses!**
